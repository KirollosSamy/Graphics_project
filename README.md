## üìô About <a name = "about"></a>

"Al Makrmsha" is an engaging single-player game that offers players a thrilling and immersive
experience set in a spooky house. The objective of the game is to find a hidden key within a specified
time limit to rescue a trapped person and escape from the house. The game features the Granny
character, who can hear any sounds made by the player and will pursue them if they are detected.
The game offers several interactive elements to make the gameplay more interesting and challenging.

The player can collect coins scattered throughout the house to gain extra time and participate in mini-
games or puzzles to earn additional time. The game includes traps such as the lights going out or a

scary face appearing, which can cause the player to lose time or be caught by Granny. The game also
features physics, with objects in the house moving and reacting to the player's actions.
The game offers different levels of difficulty, catering to players of varying skill levels. As the difficulty
level increases, the game becomes more challenging with additional objects, lighting, scary faces,
faster Granny speed, time reduction, an extended house, and immersive music.
"Al-Makrmsha" provides an immersive and engaging experience for players who enjoy puzzle-solving,
exploration, and suspenseful gameplay. The ultimate goal of finding the key, rescuing a trapped
person, and escaping from the house adds to the thrill of the gameplay, making it a must-play for
gamers who enjoy a challenging and immersive experience.
