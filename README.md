experience set in a spooky house. The objective of the game is to find a hidden key within a specified
time limit to rescue a trapped person and escape from the house. The game features the Granny
character, who can hear any sounds made by the player and will pursue them if they are detected.
The game offers several interactive elements to make the gameplay more interesting and challenging.

The player can collect coins scattered throughout the house to gain extra time and participate in mini-

level increases, the game becomes more challenging with additional objects, lighting, scary faces,
faster Granny speed, time reduction, an extended house, and immersive music.
