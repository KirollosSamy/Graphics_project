    * Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC) Space is a common coordinate system used to represent
    * the final stage of a graphics pipeline. After a 3D model is transformed and projected onto a 2D screen,
    * the resulting coordinates are typically in device coordinates, which are specific to the display hardware.
    * it differs from screen to screen based on the Resolution(WindowSize.x, WindowSize.y).
