1. high level of abstraction for main modules (objects)
2. how those module might interact (talk to each other ?)
3. the whole flow of the game **(Flow chart**)

   ===================================================
   -*try to study as much as can be for one object, then build the rest of objects
   ===============================================================================

   *-* first approach for one meet the the other for another meet*



MAIN OBJECTS:

* house->some objects within the house
* scary faces
* Granny
* KEY (different sizes)
* 

TODOS:

- Separate objects from house (Texture and  physics of the game )
- Physics Engine


problems:

* granny paths
* collision ?
* download tools and drawer



# We need to see how we can use a physics engine !!?
