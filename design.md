1. high level of abstraction for main modules (objects)
2. how those module might interact (talk to each other ?)
3. the whole flow of the game **(Flow chart**)

   ===================================================
   -*try to study as much as can be for one object, then build the rest of objects
   ===============================================================================

   *-* first approach for one meet the the other for another meet*

MAIN OBJECTS:

* house->some objects within the house
* scary faces
* Granny
* KEY (different sizes)
* 

TODOS:

- Separate objects from house (Texture and  physics of the game )
- Physics Engine

problems:

* granny paths
* collision ?
* download tools and drawer

# We need to see how we can use a physics engine !!?

| - Â implemented usingÂ mciSendString which is a function inÂ Windows API and is used to send command<br />Â strings to control multimedia devices and services. | mciSendString("commandÂ  PATH", NULL, 0, NULL);<br />takes variety of commands to control multimedia devices and services in Windows<br /><br />we should call it first with command open and file path to open the audio file<br />then call function again with the needed command and options |

### this commands are :

#### * `open`: Opens a multimedia file or device and assigns it an alias name.

* `close`: Closes a multimedia file or device.
* `play`: Plays a multimedia file or device.
* `stop`: Stops playing a multimedia file or device.
* `pause`: Pauses playback of a multimedia file or device.
* `resume`: Resumes playback of a paused multimedia file or device.
* `seek`: Seeks to a specific location in a multimedia file.
* `set`: Sets various properties of a multimedia device or service, such as volume or playback speed.
* `status`: Retrieves the status of a multimedia device or service, such as the current position of playback.

1. Load the image you want to display using an image loading library such as SOIL or DevIL. This will give you a texture ID that you can use to reference the image.
2. Set up an OpenGL quad that will cover the entire screen. You can do this by defining four vertices with texture coordinates that map to the corners of the screen.
3. Bind the texture you loaded in step 1 to the quad using the texture ID.
4. Render the quad to the screen using OpenGL's immediate mode or a vertex buffer object.
5. Wait for the desired amount of time using a timer or sleep function.
6. Clear the front buffer using `glClear()` to remove the quad and any other graphics from the screen.
